# Mern frontend tutorial

I am working through https://fullstackopen.com/en/ to learn best practice for building MERN apps.

This is my frontend repo, following this tutorial: https://fullstackopen.com/en/part2

I have also followed the instructions in part 3 (https://fullstackopen.com/en/part3/deploying_app_to_internet) to deploy the app to the internet. See the README in the backend repo for more details: https://github.com/edpackard/mern-project-backend

To set up a local version of this app, you will need to set up a development server following the instructions here: https://github.com/edpackard/mern-project-backend

Once this is completed and working on localhost:3001, follow these steps:

```
git clone https://github.com/edpackard/mern-project-frontend.git
cd mern-project-frontend
npm install
npm start
open http:/localhost:3000
```
